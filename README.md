# FastQwerty
!! WIP !! 

Its the same as a standard US Qwerty but pressing CapsLock gives you easy access to frequently used Linux and Programming symbols.

This layout is my combination of ideas inspired from 
1) Real Programmer Dvoark https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards
2) ThreeLayout https://github.com/jackrosenthal/threelayout
3) 3l Symbols https://git.sr.ht/~talos/threelayout-symbols

## Who is it for:

1) My little finger hurts
2) I don't want to learn a new keyboard layout.
3) I need to use other standard qwerty keyboards( shared office machines, family computer etc.)

## How it works:

The base layer is a standard US Qwerty layout. However, when you press CapsLock the symbols layer can be used. Its like using the Shift key, the CapsLock key needs to be held on when pressing the other keys.
I tried to minimize the use of the little finger for most used Linux/Programming symbols


## Base Layer:

## Fast Qwerty Layer:
Press and Hold the CapsLock key

## Reasons behind some of the key positions:

1) Contrary to the popular stories, I can't live only in the terminal. I need to use Slack, Confluence, Jira , Email Client etc. which defeats the point of only having a programmer focused layout.Hence, the easy access to End,Delete and Backspace.

2) I also optimised the layout for my Linux terminal/Vim usage. Hence, the easy access to  '/\' , '-' , ':' and ESC keys. 
3) I try to make the key position easy to remember, d for delete, m for modulo etc. 

## Misc: 

I have the right Ctrl mapped as my Compose key for Latin characters. E.g 'Compose' +'c' +',' gives 'ç'
